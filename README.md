## Hi there üëã

[![wakatime](https://wakatime.com/badge/user/8a630ea5-c750-4449-ace1-8664ab9da1f8.svg)](https://wakatime.com/@8a630ea5-c750-4449-ace1-8664ab9da1f8)

- ü§ù I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on: anything

- ‚ö° Fun fact: My first experience with code was writing HTML around 2006 when I created a basic website for my online video game team. It also had a phpbb forum. What ensued thereafter was a long hiatus up until 2017/2018 when I got back into programming again by learning Python, then JavaScript and TypeScript. In 2022, I started learning Rust, followed by git, CI, vim/neovim and Lua.

All of my free time is spent coding, having fun coding, and trying to learn as much about computers as humanly possible. I also like to experiment and work on hobby projects as well as contribute to other projects.

## Strongpoints

- General Programming
- [TypeScript][ts] and TypeScript types
- [ECMAScript][es]
- [Node.js][node], js/ts and npm packages
- RegEx (flavors: vim, js)
- POSIX shell and utilities

## What I'm Liking

- [Rust][rs] (language, memory safety, ecosystem, toolchain, docgen, book/learning material, etc.)
- [TypeScript][ts] (the best thing to ever happen to JavaScript! along with node)
- Vim/[Neovim](nvim) is pretty cool
- [Nix](https://nixos.org)
