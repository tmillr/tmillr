## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: a bunch of unfinished projects, improving my system and workflow (organization/configuration/scaffolding), messing with raspberry pi

- 📖📚 I’m currently learning: Rust, Vim/Neovim (and Lua), and GitHub/CI/devops/magaging repos and packages

- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on: anything

- ⚡ Fun fact: My first experience with code was writing HTML around 2006 when I created a (very) basic website for my video game team. It also had a phpbb forum. What ensued thereafter was a very long hiatus up until just a few years ago (2017/2018ish) when I got back into programming again by learning Python, then JavaScript. A few months ago (early 2022) I started learning Rust. 

All of my free time is spent coding, having fun coding, and trying to learn as much about computers as humanly possible. I also like to experiment and work on hobby projects as well as contribute to other projects. I have a few years of full-time experience at this point across several hobby projects.

## Strongpoints

- [TypeScript][ts] and TypeScript types
- [ECMAScript][es]
- [Node.js][node], js/ts and npm packages
- RegEx (flavors: vim, js)
- POSIX shell and utilities
- [Triplebyte Assessment/Cert](https://triplebyte.com/tb/tyler-miller-sjmnuqo/certificate)

## What I'm Liking

- [Rust][rs] (language, memory safety, ecosystem, toolchain, docgen, book/learning material, etc.)
- [TypeScript][ts] (the best thing to ever happen to JavaScript! along with node)
- Vim/Neovim is pretty cool
